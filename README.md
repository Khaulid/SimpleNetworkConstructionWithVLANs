Here I learned how to:

Design a network to connect accounts and delivery departments 
Each department has two PCs and one printer 

appropriate number of switches and routers added 
using the network address given 192.168.40.0, all interfaces must be configured with the appropriate IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateway. 
connectivity tested

Subnetting work shown. This was simply a walkthrough to demonstrate understanding.
